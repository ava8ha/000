# "Where The Hell Have You Been Loca"
This (in)famous line has been dragged to hell and back by more people than just *twilight-fanatics*. Some even consider it a cultural reset.

_Let's talk about it_

I am sure we are all aware of the chokehold Twilight has on all of us. And if you think you're spared- No you aren't.
The Saga has got all of us. Some more than others. But one thing we cannot deny as a Society, is *the* cultural reset that happened between 2008 and 2012. AKA the release of the five Twilight films.

Now, with the inevitable comeback of this classic, there will be new memes and quotations formed as nowadays anything can be a joke. 
So the people found it funny to poimt put the _cringeness_ of the movies.

And if my bias hasn't given it awy already, i think it's a shame. Because of this, the only way to be vocal about liking twilight, is saying you mean it ironically.
Ofcourse i do not know how socially acceptable it was to like Twilight back in 2008, but i can assure you, it barely is now.
