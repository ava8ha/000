# "Where The Hell Have You Been Loca"
This (in)famous line has been dragged to hell and back by more people than just  *twilight-fanatics*. Some even consider it a cultural reset.

#### _Let's talk about it_

I am sure we are all aware of the chokehold [Twilight](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=cd0bc905f22720c2JmltdHM9MTY2MDIwNzcyMSZpZ3VpZD1kZWZlZGJhNy03OWE5LTQzMDgtYTJhMy1iZDU4NmI3MDEwOGMmaW5zaWQ9NTIxNA&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=6646ec65-1952-11ed-a63b-88e8285e13a9&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvVGhlX1R3aWxpZ2h0X1NhZ2FfKGZpbG1fc2VyaWVzKQ&ntb=1)
has on all of us. And if you think you're spared- No you aren't.
The Saga has got all of us. Some more than others. But one thing we cannot deny as a Society, is *the* cultural reset that happened between `2008` and `2012`. AKA the release of the five Twilight films.

Now, with the inevitable comeback of this classic, there will be new memes and quotations formed as nowadays anything can be a joke. 
So the people found it funny to poimt put the _cringeness_ of the movies.

And if my ***bias*** hasn't given it away already, i think it's a shame. Because of this, the only way to be vocal about liking twilight, is  meaning it ironically.
Ofcourse i do not know how socially acceptable it was to like Twilight back in `2008`, but i can assure you, it ~~barely is~~ isn't now.
